My diploma project
The project is aimed at implementing a restaurant complex management system. The main advantage of this system is its centralization. The main founder of a restaurant chain can observe and control the processes taking place in all restaurants at the same time.
Implemented a system for adding a restaurant, its interactive map, changing, deleting.
Implemented a system for adding employees, products, booking management.
Added the ability for users with the "waiter" type to create an order, send it to the chef, and the chef, accordingly, can mark the readiness of the order.
The ability to print a receipt has been implemented.
